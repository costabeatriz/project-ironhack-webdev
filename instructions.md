CPU picks a random word
Changer word letters into dashes
Player tries to guess it, letter by letter. 
Each time they guess a letter correctly, the CPU fills in the blanks for each occurrence of that letter. 
When player guesses a letter that isnâ€™t in the word, they lose a point and CPU draws part of a stickman for each wrong guess. 
If CPU completes the stickman before the player guesses the word, player loses.
